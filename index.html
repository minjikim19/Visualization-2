    <p>In this visualization, colors represent the parents of each data(the hex numbers and each genre/platform/publishers are in the script.js file), and the size of the bars at the outer circle represents the global sales of each data. The main design concept is a ring-shaped graph and this visualization emphasizes the amount of the total global sales for each game.
        Also, the size of the inner rings is used to show the total amount of each variables' categories / total amount of each variable.</p>
